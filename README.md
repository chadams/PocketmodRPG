# Pocketmod RPG System

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## What is this about?

Pocketmod RPG is a TTRPG system where you role-play in a variety of settings, inspired by PbtA.

The main goal of this game is to provide a "dice-less" TTRPG experience you can fit in your pocket. (and play in line at theme parks!) It's rules-lite and uses a single d6 for resolutions using the "dice roller" Pocketmod tool. [see Pocketmod.com](http://pocketmod.com)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## How does it work?

This game is a discussion between the GM (a.k.a "Game Master") and the players. The GM will help guide the players by creating obstacles when narratively necessary. It is however, the players who mainly drive the story. The characters play using their "moves". Each move has a trigger and an effect and may also trigger other moves. If a character triggers a move immediately perform the move and/or moves and then continue the story.

> Example:</br>
> If a character is to act in a way where the outcome is unknown and the situation is "risky" then this is "The Risky Move". Roll a d6 and check the result on the destiny table. The GM fully narrates the outcome. The player then can resist that outcome by using the "That's not what I heard!" basic move to make adjustments on the tables rank. The GM then narrates the new outcome.

The GM should ask questions and paint the world. They will also create complications and obstacles for the players to keep things interesting.

### Safety

Before you start a session make sure everyone is comfortable with the tone, topics & themes that may appear. Everyone should also understand the **"Fade to Black" move**.

## Character Creation

|                     |                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**            | Your characters name                                    |
| **Level**           | This is the number of character tags you may have       |
| **Character Tags**  | Choose several positive tags to describe your character |
| **Character Quest** | Choose one, when completed level up                     |

Your starting level is 3. So start with 3 character tags, then make each tag a tier 3. Your "animal" tag is a catch-all and allows you to perform feats your species can naturally perform.

### Tags Explained

Tags help describe your character and they are also used as a mechanic to change your fate. A tag always has a tier (between 1 & 3). If the outcome of a roll is unfavorable, use the "That's not what I heard!" basic move with one of your tags to change the die result. If a tag ever becomes a tier 0, it is removed and instead becomes a negative tag at -1 tier. Please keep all your tags relevant to the narrative. Be aware that just because you lose a tag like your "animal" tag, doesn't mean you are no longer an animal, it just means you are questioning, or feeling bad about this part of your nature. Tags are regenerated during various moves, so track your tags' tiers separately; so you can always reset them.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Destiny Table

Most moves have you roll against the destiny table.

| Die | Result                                              |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 6   | Success                                             |
| 5   | Success, but lesser effect                          |
| 4   | Success, but added complication                     |
| 3   | Fail, also create/tick a clock                      |
| 2   | Fail, also add complication or create/tick a clock  |
| 1   | Fail, also add complication and create/tick a clock |

### Basic Moves

> **The Controlled Move** </br>
> The character does something where the result is unknown in a controlled environment. (_ex. Nobody's around, there's no alarm system_) Roll 1d6+1, then the GM continues.

> **The Risky Move** </br>
> The character does something where the result is unknown in a risky situation. (_ex. A guard is coming or there's an alarm system_) Roll 1d6, then the GM continues.
> </br>**6**: Great effect, also ( _tag_+1 ) , **1**: ( _tag_-1 )

> **The Desperate Move** </br>
> The character does something where the result is unknown in a desperate situation. (_ex. A guard is running at you with sword drawn_) Roll 1d6, then the GM continues.
> </br>**6**: Great effect, also ( _tag_+2 ) , **1-3**: ( _tag_-1 )

> **The "That's not what I heard!" Move** </br>
> Upon consulting the destiny table, if you don't like the result, adjust the result by a least one of your positive tag tiers, then reduce that tag by 1 ( _tag_-1 ). Try adding this somehow into the story.

> **The Short Rest move** </br>
> Only available once each unique time you are in a controlled environment and out of danger. Increase a tag ( _tag+1_ )

> **The Long Rest move** </br>
> Only available once each morning, after you have slept, in a controlled environment and out of danger. Increase all tags ( all _tags+1_ )

> **The Help Others move** </br>
> You may help another character if they don't like the result of the destiny table. adjust the result by a least one of your positive tag tiers, then reduce that tag by 1 ( _tag_-1 ). Try adding this somehow into the story.

> **The "Remember When?" move** </br>
> Anytime you really want to do something but you don't have the right tag for it, then use this move. First, Give a quick "flash back" scene proving you have that tag. Then give yourself that temporary tag. Make a note linking that tag to another one of your character tags and set it to the same tier. They now increase and decrease together. If you lose the tag you lose them both, but only one negative tag is created.

> **The "Journey of Transformation" move** </br>
> Each session a character is given a quest used for advancement in that session. If you create a scene about overcoming your quest, mark it as completed. You will gain a level at the end of the session. _see GM quests_

> **The "Fade to Black" move** </br>
> Anytime and for any reason (no questions asked) any participant may say "Fade to Black" immediately stopping a scene that is becoming uncomfortable.
