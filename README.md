Pocketmod RPG System
What is this about?
Pocketmod RPG is a TTRPG system where you role-play in a variety of settings, inspired by PbtA.

The main goal of this game is to provide a "dice-less" TTRPG experience you can fit in your pocket. (and play in line at theme parks!) It's rules-lite and uses a single d6 for resolutions using the "dice roller" Pocketmod tool. see Pocketmod.com

How does it work?
This game is a discussion between the storyteller and the players. The storyteller will help guide the players by creating obstacles when narratively necessary. It is however, the players who mainly drive the story. The characters play using their "moves". Each move has a trigger and an effect and may also trigger other moves. If a character triggers a move immediately perform the move and/or moves and then continue the story.

Example:
If a character is to act in a way where the outcome is unknown and the situation is "risky" then this is "The Risky Move". Roll a d6 and check the result on the destiny table. The storyteller fully narrates the outcome. The player then can resist that outcome by using the "That's not what I heard!" basic move to make adjustments on the tables rank. The storyteller then narrates the new outcome.
Character Creation

Tags Explained
Tags help describe your character and they are also used as a mechanic to change your fate. A tag always has a tier (between 1 & 3). If the outcome of a roll is unfavorable, use the "That's not what I heard!" basic move with one of your tags to change the die result. If a tag ever becomes a tier 0, it is removed and instead becomes a negative tag at -1 tier. Please keep all your tags relevant to the narrative. Be aware that just because you lose a tag like your "animal" tag, doesn't mean you are no longer an animal, it just means you are questioning, or feeling bad about this part of your nature. Tags are regenerated during various moves, so track your tags' tiers separately; so you can always reset them.

Destiny Table
Most moves have you roll against the destiny table.

6 Success
5 Success, but lesser effect

Basic Moves
The Controlled Move
The character does something where the result is unknown in a controlled environment. (ex. Nobody's around, there's no alarm system) Roll 1d6+1, then the storyteller continues.

The Risky Move
The character does something where the result is unknown in a risky situation. (ex. A guard is coming or there's an alarm system) Roll 1d6, then the storyteller continues.
6: Great effect, also ( tag+1 ) , 1: ( tag-1 )

The Desperate Move
The character does something where the result is unknown in a desperate situation. (ex. A guard is running at you with sword drawn) Roll 1d6, then the storyteller continues.
6: Great effect, also ( tag+2 ) , 1-3: ( tag-1 )

The "That's not what I heard!" Move
Upon consulting the destiny table, if you don't like the result, adjust the result by a least one of your positive tag tiers, then reduce that tag by 1 ( tag-1 ). Try adding this somehow into the story.

The Short Rest move
Only available once each unique time you are in a controlled environment and out of danger. Increase a tag ( tag+1 )

The Long Rest move
Only available once each morning, after you have slept, in a controlled environment and out of danger. Increase all tags ( all tags+1 )

The Help Others move
You may help another character if they don't like the result of the destiny table. adjust the result by a least one of your positive tag tiers, then reduce that tag by 1 ( tag-1 ). Try adding this somehow into the story.

The "Remember When?" move
Anytime you really want to do something but you don't have the right tag for it, then use this move. First, Give a quick "flash back" scene proving you have that tag. Then give yourself that temporary tag. Make a note linking that tag to another one of your character tags and set it to the same tier. They now increase and decrease together. If you lose the tag you lose them both, but only one negative tag is created.

The "Fade to Black" move
Anytime and for any reason (no questions asked) any participant may say "Fade to Black" immediately stopping a scene that is becoming uncomfortable.
